# Real Life Examples Using OOP:
This project contains 4 tasks.

It is advised to do all tasks by each member of the group individually.

The project tasks can also be divided between two sub-groups. One subgroup can work on tasks **[1](TASK_1.md)** and **[3](TASK_3.md)**. And the other subgroup can work on tasks **[2](TASK_2.md)** and **[4](TASK_4.md)**.

For the test files to work correctly, the arguments in the constructor methods must be defined in the same order as in shown in the table.

Finally, the solutions provided are one way of modelling the problems. Feel free to come up with your own solution and discuss it with your group members and your teacher.
